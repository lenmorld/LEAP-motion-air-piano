LEAP motion (sort of) piano, using LeapJS

sort of, because 
- it is reading if a finger is "extended" over the LEAP sensors, compared to actual tapping of keys
- very simple, uses only 10 random keys from the actual set 

LeapJS library makes it easier for development, 
because it includes all sort of methods for monitoring hand and finger movements and gestures
